# 3D game tutorial (port to Rust)

Porting to Rust a Python tutorial for creating a 3D game made by [StanislavPetrovV](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game).

*Caution!* This is a work in progress, I have migrated it to Tetra (highly recommend), but I still have some issue with textures that I can't resolve, and so haven't progressed further.

I have used textures from the original tutorial, as far as I know they are free to use. In any case, this project is only intented as a learning experience, for me and (I hope) for a few other people, if I manage to finish it.
